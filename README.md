This project is about continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using a powerful combination of Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub Webhooks, all running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform
I'll leverage Docker, the leading containerization technology, to containerize our applications, making them easily portable and scalable. By combining Docker with Jenkins and Ansible, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how to create an efficient and flexible CI/CD pipeline.
I'll explore the power of GitHub Webhooks, enabling automated triggering of our CI/CD pipeline upon code commits, ensuring seamless integration of your application changes with minimal manual intervention.
With the entire project running on AWS, I'll also take advantage of cloud computing's benefits, such as scalability and availability, ensuring your CI/CD pipeline can handle projects of any size.
By the end of this project l'll have a fully functional, automated CI/CD pipeline that significantly improves your development workflow, empowers collaboration, and boosts your project's overall efficiency.
